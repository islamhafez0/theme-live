My studies introduced me to oils and understanding their key health benefits - surprised, unsure and extremely sceptical, I wasn’t in a position to pass down a trial, so I gave it a shot.<\/p><p><br\/><\/p><p>To my surprise, a few months later my skin had completely changed. The extreme difference over time, meant I was attracting a lot of common questions, we all seek today. What is your routine? How did you get your skin to clear up? What products are you using? From this Herbal Gardens was born.<\/p>"

As our motto goes, ‘When beauty meets Nature’, we are driven to provide skincare solutions using the power of nature. Nature works via symbiotic relationships: everything is connected, everything is in balance, and every illness has a remedy. Every plant has protective qualities, ways it hydrates itself, nourishes itself, and ways it thrives. We formulate our products by studying these qualities and emulating them in our selection of active botanical ingredients and the nutrients they provide. We’ve packed over 40 of these nutrients into each of our products, to ensure you get the most out of every product. <\/p>"
